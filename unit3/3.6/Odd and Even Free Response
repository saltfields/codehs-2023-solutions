What was wrong with the program?
The main issue I found was that for the odd numbers, it was checking OR when it should have been checking AND. I don't know if it was correct other than that, as I rewrote it to make sense to me.

The other one seemed to have the same problem, as it didn't work half the time, but I rewrote it with an && symbol instead of || and it worked.



What expression was the programmer trying to use that gave the error? Relate your answer to De Morgan's Laws.
The || was the symbol they were trying to use that gave the error, when they should have been using the && symbol. This is because in order to check if two things are both right, you have to use the && symbol and not just the || symbol usually.



How did you resolve the error?

I rewrote the program with && symbols.
