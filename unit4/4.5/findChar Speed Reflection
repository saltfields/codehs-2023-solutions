1. My method was more efficient since the time it took to run was less.
2. My method was more efficient because it only has one execution where it checks if the string compares the character, compared to the other one where it checks one character at a time if that is the correct character.
3. Efficiency in programming is important as it makes code easier to read and also means that lower-end systems can run programs that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to.
